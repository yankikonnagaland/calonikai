# Replit.md - All Food Calorie Tracker

## Overview

This is a full-stack All Food Calorie Tracker web application built with React/TypeScript frontend and Express.js backend. The application helps users track their daily calorie intake through all foods, manage their meal plans, monitor exercise routines, and get personalized nutrition recommendations based on their profile.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Frontend Architecture:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool for fast development
- Component-based architecture with shadcn/ui design system
- TanStack Query for efficient server state management
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for form handling

**Backend Architecture:**
- Express.js server with TypeScript
- RESTful API design
- Session-based user identification using nanoid
- In-memory storage with interface abstraction for future database migration
- Middleware for request logging and error handling

**Database Architecture:**
- Currently uses in-memory storage (MemStorage class)
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL migration
- Schema defines tables for foods, meal items, user profiles, and exercises
- Database abstraction through IStorage interface

## Key Components

**Core Data Models:**
- Foods: Comprehensive all food database with nutritional information
- Meal Items: User's selected foods with quantities and units
- User Profiles: Personal information for BMR/TDEE calculations
- Exercises: Activity tracking for calorie burn calculations

**Frontend Components:**
- Navigation: Tab-based navigation between tracker, profile, and exercise
- FoodSearch: Autocomplete search with smart unit selection
- MealSummary: Real-time meal tracking with nutritional totals
- UserProfile: BMR/TDEE calculator with animated results
- ExerciseTracker: Timer-based exercise tracking
- HealthyAlternatives: AI-powered food swap suggestions

**Backend Services:**
- Storage abstraction layer (IStorage interface)
- RESTful route handlers for all CRUD operations
- Validation using Zod schemas
- Session management for user data isolation

## Data Flow

1. **User Session**: Each user gets a unique session ID stored in localStorage
2. **Food Search**: Real-time search queries to backend with debouncing
3. **Meal Building**: Selected foods added to session-specific meal collection
4. **Profile Calculation**: BMR/TDEE computed based on user inputs
5. **Exercise Tracking**: Timer-based activity logging with calorie burn calculation
6. **Data Persistence**: All user data tied to session ID for temporary storage

## External Dependencies

- tailwindcss: Utility-first CSS framework
- lucide-react: Icon library

**Backend Dependencies:**
- express: Web framework
- drizzle-orm: Type-safe ORM
- @neondatabase/serverless: Database driver
- nanoid: Unique ID generation
- tsx: TypeScript execution

**Development Dependencies:**

- typescript: Type checking
- esbuild: Bundle optimization

## Deployment Strategy

**Development Environment:**
- Vite dev server for frontend hot reloading
- tsx for backend TypeScript execution
- Concurrent development with proxy setup

**Production Build:**
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized React bundle
- Backend: esbuild bundles Express server
- Static files served from Express in production

**Database Migration Path:**
- Current: In-memory storage for development
- Future: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM migrations
- Database URL configuration through environment variables

**Replit Configuration:**
- Node.js 20 runtime environment
- PostgreSQL module for future database integration
- Auto-deployment with build/start scripts
- Port 5000 mapped to external port 80
